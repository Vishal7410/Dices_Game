# Dices_Game
• The Dice Guessing Game is an interactive and  engaging web application that I developed as a frontend  project using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.js. 
• The game provides an enjoyable experience where  players can test their intuition and luck by guessing the  number rolled on a standard six-sided dice.
